v-1.0.0
This template is based on 3 main things:
1) Bootstrap framework 
2) HTML5 BoilerPlate framework
3) Single index navigation.

First of all Bootstrap is obviously a well-documented framework that popular becasue it is awesome.
	Second, the HTML5 BoilerPlate, quite simply has "the combined knowledge and effort of 100s of developers, 
all in one little package." They have ironed out most of the "hiccups" you would run into designing 
adaptable ,cross-browser friendly,future-friendly, web applications and kiosks.
	And third, "Single Index Navigation", called that because I don't know what else to call it. But it 
works like this. The index is the 'only' place you have to set '<head>' information, and include 'javascripts'.
And, by listening for 'query string parameters', we can easily pull in new page views via a jquery ajax call,
without leaving the index.html
	It also contains a folder full of templates based on previously designed Codigo kiosks. And it is designed 
with only html,css, and javascript to fit within our typical kiosk environment.

and inside the "doc" file of the template, you can see all the thought they put into it.


This particular version can easily be expanded upon as well.

Single Index Navigation:
WOrks like this ...
you have an anchor tag with parameters for the page(pg), title, and modal.
<a href="?pg=home.html&title=home&modal=home-modal.html">Home</a>

Down at the bottom of the page there's a ...jquery document ready function.
$(document).ready(function() {

}
That listens for the parameters and changes the appropriate divs.
